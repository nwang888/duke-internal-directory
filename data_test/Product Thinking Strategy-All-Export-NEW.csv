Copilot,10/17/2023 5:53pm,"This product is combining similar to combining ChatGPT with a code IDE. However, instead of needing to copy and paste the code or going to a different window, the tool is already integrated into the environment. ","Similar to ChatGPT, users can ask CoPilot a coding question and ask for help to debug. In my case, I used it in conjunction with GitHub's codespace. However, there were options to add it as an extension to other IDEs, such as VScode. ","Because ChatGPT does something similar, I believe that they're trying to win product strategy by directly combining the capabilities of AI with code. That way, instead of users having to copy and paste code to an AI environment, they can directly ask the AI tool to reference their code file.

Copilot,10/18/2023 11:17pm,GitHub Copilot is an extensions that boosts software development efficiency by offering AI-driven code assistance. It works with Open AI to use make software developers write code more efficiently and effectively with completion features.  ,"Copilot's main feature is its ability to provide code suggestions and autocompletion. This is prevalent in its tab feature and often the code snippets are more useful for repetitive tasks. The extension also supports a lot of programming languages and adapts to whichever once you are using in the file.Coplilot also does documentation along the way which speeds up the coding processes for developers and allows the code to be more readable. It also allows you to accept or discard edits so you can customize your suggestions as best as possible. ",Copilot aims to make lower level coding as efficient as possible for software developers so they can focus on higher level tasks. It makes software development appear less repetitive and more enjoyable while still allowing for human judgment and review. ,,
Copilot,10/19/2023 12:05pm,"It seems to be serving an AI coding partner type role. The same way a lot people use chat GPT to write code for them, this allows a coder to do the same thing but all on github. It also seems to be very accurate and keeps track of the code you write. ","When writing a line of comment, it will automatically generate all the code. It also serves as a plug-in that works in many popular coding languages and environments serving as a versatile ""partner"" for developers.","The product is clearly attacking the huge wave of genAI infiltrating the market. With chatGPT being the most commonly used genAI by the average user, github copilot aims to assist a niche of coders in an environment most coders are familiar with, github.

Copilot,10/18/2023 2:03pm,"I believe the product is trying to fuse the widespread prevalence of AI as an assistive tool with coding. By incorporating AI functionalities in a coding and development platform, users are able to seek help across dozens of coding languages in real-time. ","The GitHub Copilot chat functionality is embedded right next to the code file itself, making it very easy to transfer code over without having to go back and forth between different pages and files. Moreover, you are able to ask follow-up questions to the AI Bot, which is incredibly helpful if the generated code isn't quite right or if you are confused as to how it works. The copy feature makes it very easy to copy over code. In addition, the insert at cursor feature is incredibly useful when trying to merge together two different pieces of code. I really appreciate how the Copilot doesn't just output code but also offers an explanation as to how the code is working and what parameters need to be passed in. ","By adding AI assistive technology, GitHub enhances its positioning as one of the largest development platforms. It does so because such an addition allows users to code faster and build greater, more innovative products as they are now able to benefit from data trained on billions of lines of code. Not only does this addition assist fluent programmers in writing code faster, but it is also greatly useful to new programmers. In this way, GitHub Copilot has great user value across the board, assisting GitHub in gaining market share. ",,

This saves time and resources.,"I think this is a way to enable software developers to become more efficient and therefore be more productive in the workforce. This will make companies want to have CoPilot because they could save a lot of resources by implementing it. I think they will win in the market because a lot of people already use git --- so this will be a natural addition and also because copilot works with languages like python and javascript. These are languages that are easy to pickup, so if you don't have to write all the code, at least you can read it and slightly understand it which will make it easier for people who are not as experienced to be able to you it and become a resource for the company.

Copilot,10/19/2023 12:28pm,Github Copilot is an AI tool that uses chat mechanics to assist coders directly inside their IDE's by acting as an idea generator for code.,"The Copilot profile picture of an OC gives the impression that this is a sort of personal assistant, similar to those on websites that have the chatbots in the corner with avatars or names. Further, this ""personal assistant"" starts every fresh chat with ""Hi __, how can I help you"" followed by some information about what the copilot chat is, how it can be useful to the user, and most importantly, a note that there might be some mistakes. Also, the chatbot, unless told to be in the main IDE workspace, stays on the left side of the IDE in browser - this gives the impression that it is more of a tool, rather than the purpose of github itself.","I believe that the goal for Copilot by Github is to provide access to an AI tool directly in the IDE so that users, if they need it, do not have to flip between their code base and another AI platform or software. It is all in one place, nicely packaged with tools that make the implementation of output code easy. I think they can win in the market just by doing everything else other AI chats do but more targeted towards coders, which is what they have already done so far. Chatbots like ChatGPT are great but they are not trained for coding specifically, which sometimes makes their results arbitrary, and ultimately unuseful. Copilot wants to provide in-house AI tools for customers who are already using Github to code. In addition to monetary benefits, Copilot will also grow demonstrated interest in the IDE with tools that make troubleshooting and coding that much easier. ",,
Copilot,10/19/2023 12:38am,"GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. The primary goal of this product is to help developers write code more efficiently by providing real-time suggestions as they type. It aims to enhance productivity, reduce common mistakes, offer solutions to coding problems, and potentially accelerate the learning process for newcomers to programming.","Code Suggestions: As soon as you start typing, Copilot provides autocomplete-style suggestions. This immediate response is akin to a pair programmer suggesting the next line or helping complete the current one.Contextual Understanding: Copilot doesn't just offer random suggestions. It's context-aware, meaning it tailors its suggestions based on the code you've already written in the current file or function. This dynamic adaptation enforces the impression of having an ""intelligent"" assistant.","By introducing Copilot, GitHub enriches its suite of developer tools. This makes the entire GitHub platform more attractive and essential to developers, potentially increasing user retention and engagement. By observing how developers interact with Copilot's suggestions and which ones they accept or modify, GitHub can continuously improve the tool, ensuring it stays relevant and effective.",,

Clearly, the makers of CoPilot intend for it to be used seamlessly along side your exiting suite of coding software. I installed it into PyCharm which is my favorite tool for writing python code. CoPilot has been really helpful for me because it automatically shows suggestions for code which I can accept by hitting the ""tab"" key. It also didn't require me to change anything about the way I write code to use it.","CoPilot uses GitHub as part of its larger brandname. The AI is trained on GitHubs large open source collection of code that users from around the world have submitted. This means that it is trained on modern coding practices and the latest libraries. In addition, GitHub allows students to get free access to the service while in school (just like other premium GitHub features in their developer bundle). This means that students who are used to using CoPilot will then purchase it at their jobs after college, or even more likely, employees will subscribe to enterprise grade plans to allow all of their engineers to use CoPilot at scale. By offering the product to students, CoPilot builds a loyal customer base who become used to the convenience it offers.","As I mentioned in my video. An added benefit I noticed about CoPilot is that it can read code that you (or it) wrote and then help you write descriptive ""comments"" above your code documenting and explaining how it works. This can save a lot of time and writing good documentation is very important when collobaritng on a large coding project at a company or on a team.",
Copilot,10/19/2023 1:49pm,It is trying to accomplish a way to help coders or people who are writing many lines of code by suggesting fixes or sentence completions based and done by an AI programmer. ,"On the website, from what I can see it was super simple to operate and the point is made very clear on what the purpose of the website truly is to help people who code by not only providing a secure database to do so, but also providing you with space to write lines of code and allow the AI to offer suggestions as you go.","I believe that the goal here is to create something that does not really exist and that is an AI that helps you write lines of code. They are trying to use the new AI technological advancements in order to create a niche product that can make the lives of coders so much easier. Also, by providing student benefits that are free it would allow more people to be able to use it, being that it is more affordable as well. ",,
